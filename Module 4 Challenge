Question 1

Which of the following statements about ggplot is true?

* ggplot allows analysts to create different types of plots.

Question 2

A data analyst creates a bar chart with the diamonds dataset. They begin with the following line of code: 

ggplot(data = diamonds) :

*  The plus sign (+)

Question 3

A data analyst creates a plot using the following code chunk: 

ggplot(data = penguins) + 

   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

Which of the following represents a function in the code chunk? Select all that apply. 

* The ggplot function

* The aes function

* The geom_point function

Question 4

Which code snippet will make all of the bars in the plot have different colors and shapes based on their heights?

* ggplot(data = buildings) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = construction_year, color=height, shape=height))

Question 5

A data analyst is working with the following plot and gets an error caused by a bug. What is the cause of the bug?

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

* The plus should be at the end of the first line.

Question 6

You are working with the penguins dataset. You create a scatterplot with the following code: 

ggplot(data = penguins) +  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

You want to highlight the different years of data collection on your plot. Add a code chunk to the second line of code to map the aesthetic size to the variable year.

* geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, size=year))

Question 7

Which aesthetic of the geom_smooth function can be used to change the style of the line?

* linetype

Question 8

You are working with the diamonds dataset. You create a bar chart with the following code:

ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +

You want to use the facet_wrap() function to display subsets of your data. Add the code chunk that lets you facet your plot based on the variable clarity. 

* ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) + facet_wrap(~clarity)

Question 9

Fill in the blank: You can use the _____ function to put a text label on your plot to call out specific data points. 

* annotate() 

Question 10

In R studio, what default options does the Export functionality of the Plots tab give for exporting plots?

* PDF
* Image
